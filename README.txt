This build assumes the SDK to be located in this directory and to be called

	SaleaeAnalyzerSdk-1.1.9	

Unzipping the SaleaeAnalyzerSdk-1.1.9.zip distribution in this directory
should do the trick.

Files and Directories:

source
	Actual source code; including a simple
	Makefile.

ISO7816Analyser
	XCode build environment for above source.

Licenses.txt
	License information.

README.txt
	This file

SaleaeAnalyzerSdk-1.1.9
	Not distrubuted; but expected name
	and location of the SDK. The makefile
	and X-Code build files have hardcoded
	paths to the include.
